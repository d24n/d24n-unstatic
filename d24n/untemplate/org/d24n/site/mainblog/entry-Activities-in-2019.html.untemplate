<p>The Foundation funded eleven technical events and funded two grants in 2019. Donations worth $13,134 (at the time of donation) were received. At the end of 2019 the foundation had on- and off-chain assets worth about $7,701. We say &#8220;about&#8221; because the value of on-chain assets are not stable.</p>

<p>The foundation funded Simon Castano 0.20281 BTC (about $1920) for work on Bitcoin.jl and related software in the <a href="https://www.brane.cc/">Brane</a> project. The foundation also funded Matt Quinn 0.04805 BTC (about $455)  for bootstrapping the &#8220;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Starfish-Mission/events/259257452/">Distributed Saturdays</a>&#8221; in the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain_Free_School/">Blockchain Free school</a>. Neither of these projects have submitted a report.</p>

<p>Food for eleven Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup events were paid for by the foundation. Examples include an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/events/259342005/">event</a> on March 17 in which <a href="https://www.originprotocol.com/">Origin</a> presented their protocol for building peer-to-peer marketplaces, Vivek Bagaria presenting on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/events/260861593/">operating blockchains at physical limits</a> on May 26, a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/events/262421162/">proof-of-stake introduction</a> on June 30, and Steve Waldman <a href="https://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/events/264971060/">presenting on sbt-ethereum</a> on Oct 13. The meetup.com membership expenses for the SV Eth meetup were also paid. The foundation paid $750 for 5 months of membership at Hacker Dojo, though we have found venues at which events can be held free and stopped the Hacker Dojo membership.</p>

<p>Other expenses include $394 for domains and website hosting and $195 for to a law firm (they charged us for their response to our email telling them they were too expensive).
