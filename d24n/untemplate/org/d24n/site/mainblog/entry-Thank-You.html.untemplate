<p>Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesfickel">James Fickel</a>! The Decentralization Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and relies entirely on donations to operate and continue our vision of a decentralized future. Everyone at D24N.org is grateful for a very generous donation by James. This donation reinforces our belief of a decentralized future as well as a trust given to everyone at the Foundation to realize these goals; we at D24N.org will work hard to ensure this trust is well earned. Jamesâ€™ donation will help the Foundation fulfill its mission of promoting decentralizing technology, educating the world on its transformative potential, and funding research to improve it.</p>

<p>Thank you Gustav Simonsson!  Gustav made a large donation that funded much of our work through 2019.</p>

<p>Donations to 501(c)(3) organizations can be restricted to a specific area of focus, or be unrestricted. As an example of restricted donations, the foundation until recently allowed donations specifically for Ethereum 2 Research and Development. Unrestricted donations may be used for any of the non-profit&#8217;s charitable purposes, and are much easier for the non-profit to use.  James&#8217; and Gustav&#8217;s donations were unrestricted.</p>

<p>Thank you James and Gustav! And many thanks to our smaller donors and supporters. We are, for obvious reasons, very grateful to our larger supporters. But it&#8217;s our small donations that keep us decentralized, in harmony with our mission. Thanks to each and every one.</p>
