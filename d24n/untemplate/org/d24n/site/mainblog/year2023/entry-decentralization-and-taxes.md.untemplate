The foundationâ€™s 2022 tax return is now [available](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T8IrDdC3p4bA0LZR5ki2k5vGz4WvABkv/view).

We're a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization, so we didn't actually _pay_ any taxes. But we do carefully keep and report our accounts!

We had $19,787 in total expenses, and were left with $27,031 in total assets at the end of the year.
