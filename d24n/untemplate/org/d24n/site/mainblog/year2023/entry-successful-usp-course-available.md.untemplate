In 2022, we [made a grant](##usp-grant) to University of SÃ£o Paulo to produce a course on blockchain
and other decentralizing technologies.

We are very pleased to report that the course, "Blockchain, criptomoedas e tecnologias descentralizadas", has been developed
and is currently in progress, with an inaugural class of 67 students.
It is taught by Professor Marcos Antonio Simplicio Junior.

You can follow along at home. Course materials are available online:

* [Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcbbqdJgPgcXlRlPNHF2itTotEwr9kckl) via YouTube
* [Course materials](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/course/view.php?id=106400) via the university's course management system

If you are a Portuguese speaker, we hope that you can benefit as well.

We are excited by the success of the course. Every student is a seed. Who knows what may grow?
Many thanks to Professor Junior, and to teaching assistant Pedro Correa, for their excellent work!
