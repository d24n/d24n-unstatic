<p>We are happy to share a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12flM_E_A3DldbOUe8EYEN6Bg2bi4Yl6w/view?usp=sharing">report</a> resulting from a <a href="<( grant2SigmaPrimeLoc.relative )>">grant</a> made last year by the foundation to Sigma Prime for scientific research and development related to Ethereum 2 (Eth2). The report outlines challenges encountered and solutions found while implementing the <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> Eth2 client. To illustrate the work, we list here a few items described in the report:</p>

<ul><li>A validator shuffling optimization which resulted in a 200x speedup (see page 5),</li><li>An epoch processing optimization (page 6)</li><li>The Lighthouse <a href="https://hackmd.io/@sproul/min-max-slasher">slasher</a> (page 6)</li><li>The <a style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;" href="https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/tree/master/protocols/gossipsub">Rust implementation</a><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;"> of Gossipsub</span> including an online scoring system (pages 7,8)</li><li>Lighthouse client fuzzing (pages 8,9)</li><li>Weak Subjectivity Sync (page 8)</li></ul>

<p>The report has a wonderful set of links to further material that we encourage you to investigate for further info on these topics. The end of the report highlights the “The Merge” in which Ethereum (and Lighthouse) will transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake:</p>
