README-entries
==============

The directory structure in which entries are placed under mainblog
is entirely arbitrary, a matter of organizational convenience.

I've binned them in directories by year, but I could mix them all
up in the wrong directories and the blog ordering would be fine.

The blog looks for untemplates starting with 'entry' anywhere beneath
'mainblog'. Once it finds them, it relies upon the 'PubDate' attribute
of each entry to decide where they go.
